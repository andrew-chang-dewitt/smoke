"""
The meat & potatoes of this program, the `maintain` function uses a given `Fan`
object & single `Probe` object to attempt to reach & maintain a given
temperature by controlling fan speed in response to the temperature readings
from the probe.

Example usage:

```
from smoke.fan import Fan
import smoke.maintain
from smoke.thermistor import Probes, Probe

fan = Fan(2)              # set up fan on GPIO pin 2
probes = Probes([1, 2])   # set up probes on MCP3008 channels 0 & 1
air = Probes.get_probe(1) # get the air temp probe on probe 1

maintain(107, air, fan)   # maintain an air temp of 107 C
                          # +/- the PRECISION constant
```
